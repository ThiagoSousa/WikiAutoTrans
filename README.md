# WikiAutoTrans
Wiki translation and verification of content from different wiki projects. 
The goal is to help making accurate translation of wiki content between different languages.

### Justification of this project
English Wikipedia contains many articles that does not exist in other languages. For a while, I have been working in
translating Wikipedia's articles, mostly from English to Portuguese using 
[Wikipedia's Content translation tool](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wikipedia:Content_translation_tool). However, 
I noticed that translating with the Content's translation has some recurrent issues: 1- need to translate manually 
section by section of an articles; 2- sometimes the section is not translated at all, which leaves us to do it
manually; 3- often some non-prose textual elements, such as citations and predefinitions, are broken when translating 
the articles. This project aims to solve some of these problems. 

### How does it work?

Currently it works for wikipedia, but it is designed to work for other wikiprojects as well.
